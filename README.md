# Lemons

## About

Lemons is an iOS app that allows users to calculate the intrinsic value of companies based on a variety of factors to help them determine their value. I created the app to help a friend of mine who is really well versed in stocks but doesn't have a simple tool that allows him to determine a company's worth and what price he should buy their stock at. Lemons solves this by providing a simple interface where users can enter a few numbers relevant to a business's operations and then see a detailed overview of the company's projected value over time. My goal with this app was to help my friend reduce the burden it took for him to do finanical analysis using Excel or some other mundane, complex software, while also making financial analysis more fun and accessible.

## How it works

Lemons is super straight forward. You open the app and are greeted with a home page that has 6 cards where you can fill out information about a particular business you're interested in. If you're not sure about what a certain term means, a quick tap on the respective question mark provides a detailed explanation with an example to help out. When entering information into a card, a modern keypad appears to make entering the information super fast and painless. After entering all the information, tapping calculate brings you to a rich results page showing the current intrinsic value of the company, how much each share of their stock is valued at, as well as a graph and table showing the projected value of the company over time.
